Confucian Ideals 
 
What is the Confucian ideal for individual and political life? One common theme for personal interaction throughout Confucianism can 
be explained through the relationship between a father and his son. In return, the father should seek to pass on as much of his knowledge as possible in 
addition to nurturing the son. Over time, the relationship between father and son should become 
more mutual, with the father explaining the reason for his teachings. Li are the traditions that create and maintain a well-functioning society, such as the Confucian relationship ideals. The Emperor is expected to exemplify morality and honesty, so that 
the citizens attain intrinsic model behavior in the wake of their leaderâ€™s. However, you also need to develop the ability to apply your own judgement to a situation.
